# exit-ticket-response-compiler

A simple App script that can be used inside a Google Sheet to automate compiling Google Forms that are turned into quizzes and graded. This script is able to compile ALL google forms for a strand, topic, or grade and put them in separate Google Sheet files or all inside the same sheet as needed. It will sort by teacher automatically and then by period and then by student score. 

Examples for how this looks and needs to be set up will be added later.
